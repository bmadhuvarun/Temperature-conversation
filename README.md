# Temperature-conversation
**Introduction**
The Temperature Conversion Web App is a simple yet interactive project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Kelvin, making it a useful tool for students, researchers, and professionals who work with temperature measurements.

**Features**
âœ… User-Friendly Interface: A clean and responsive design with easy-to-use input fields and buttons.
âœ… Real-Time Conversion: Converts the temperature immediately upon clicking the submit button.
âœ… Unit Selection: Users can choose between Celsius to Kelvin and Kelvin to Celsius conversions.
âœ… Error Handling: Displays a message if no unit is selected.

**Technology Stack**
HTML: Provides the structure of the form, input fields, and labels.
CSS: Enhances the UI with styling, colors, and layout adjustments.
JavaScript: Implements logic for temperature conversion and updates the results dynamically.
**How It Works**
The user enters a temperature value in the input field.
They select the desired conversion method (Celsius to Kelvin or Kelvin to Celsius) using radio buttons.
Clicking the Submit button triggers the JavaScript function to perform the conversion.
The result is displayed on the screen.
If no unit is selected, an error message prompts the user to choose one.
Fixing Issues in JavaScript
The conversion formulas should be corrected:
Celsius to Kelvin: K = C + 273.15
Kelvin to Celsius: C = K - 273.15
The function incorrectly converts Celsius to Fahrenheit instead of Kelvin.
**Future Enhancements**
Add Fahrenheit conversion to make it more versatile.
Implement Dark Mode for better usability.
Provide real-time conversion without needing a submit button.
This project is a great learning experience for JavaScript event handling, form validation, and DOM manipulation while building a practical web application. ðŸš€
